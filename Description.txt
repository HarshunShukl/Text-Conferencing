Our text conferencing project allows for the following commands -

1. Secure Login - /login <username> <password> <server IP> <server port>
Only clients that attempt to log in with a username and password combination that matches 
with the one in the database will be allowed to connect to the server. Other connections 
will be refused.

2. Creating a session - /createsession <session ID>
Every client is allowed to create a text session. They just need to provide a name for 
the session that isn't in use already. The client will be automatically added to the
session they created.
						
3. List - /list
This command allows the client to see a list of all available sessions and the users 
present in the session.

4. Joining a session - /joinsession <session ID>
This allows the client to join an existing session from the list of active sessions.

5. Text Conferencing - <text>
This allows the clients to communicate with each other. Any text message sent is 
sent to all other clients present in the session.

6. Leaving a session - /leavesession
This results in the client leaving the session they were in. If the last client 
exits the session, the session is closed.

7. Logout - /logout
This enables the client to log out of the server at any time. The client can 
only reconnect by retyping their secure username and password.

8. Quit - /quit
This quits the program on the client's computer. The client would need to 
establish another connection with the server and then log in if he wishes
to join the conferencing session.

Additional features supplied -
1. Timeout
If the client has been inactive (i.e no activity) for more than 5 minutes,
the server forcefully removes the client from the server. If the client
wishes to rejoin th server, they must log in again.

2. Lobby
When clients log in, they are added to a default session, called lobby.
They can check for available sessions here, and correspondingly, join
an existing session or create a new session.
